## Prompt

```

```

## Response snapshot

```
Output path to generated tasks.md: specs/001-console-todo-app/tasks.md
Summary:
- Total task count: 36
- Task count per user story:
    - Setup: 6 tasks
    - Foundational: 3 tasks
    - User Story 1 (Add Task): 4 tasks
    - User Story 2 (View Tasks): 4 tasks
    - User Story 3 (Mark Complete/Incomplete): 6 tasks
    - User Story 4 (Update Task): 4 tasks
    - User Story 5 (Delete Task): 4 tasks
    - Final Phase (Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns): 5 tasks
- Parallel opportunities identified: Tasks marked with [P] (though none were explicitly marked in this detailed breakdown, individual test files could be developed in parallel with service implementations).
- Independent test criteria for each story: Provided within tasks.md under each user story's phase.
- Suggested MVP scope: User Story 1 (Add a new Todo Task) and User Story 2 (View all Todo Tasks), along with the foundational and setup tasks. This allows for basic task management.
- Format validation: All tasks follow the strict checklist format (- [ ] Txxx [P?] [Story?] Description with file path).
```

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Detailed development tasks for Console Todo App generated.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-console-todo-app/tasks.md.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The feature is ready for implementation (/sp.implement).
- 🧠 Reflection: create-phr.sh script did not output JSON; manual PHR creation was required.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: create-phr.sh script output failure.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate create-phr.sh script output.
