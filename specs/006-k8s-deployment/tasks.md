**Feature**: 006-k8s-deployment | **Spec**: [Link to spec](spec.md) | **Plan**: [Link to plan](plan.md)
**Generated**: 2026-02-04 | **Stage**: Implementation | **Method**: /sp.tasks command

## Summary

## Dependencies & Execution Order

**Dependency Graph**:
- US1 (Containerize App) → US2 (Deploy to Minikube) → US3 (Configure Production Resources)
- US1 (Containerize App) → US4 (Validate Functionality) → US5 (Demonstrate AI Ops)

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- US1 (Containerize) can be parallelized: T001-T002 [P] for frontend/backend containerization
- US2 (Deploy) can be parallelized: T006-T007 [P] for Helm chart generation
- US3 (Configure) can be parallelized: T010-T011 [P] for probes and resources


## Path Conventions

Phase 4 deployment adds Kubernetes infrastructure to existing Phase 3 application:
- **Frontend**: `phase-4-k8s-deployment/frontend/`
- **Backend**: `phase-4-k8s-deployment/backend/`
- **Helm**: `phase-4-k8s-deployment/helm/todo-app/`
- **Scripts**: `phase-4-k8s-deployment/scripts/`
- **Docs**: `phase-4-k8s-deployment/docs/`



**Suggested MVP Scope**: US1 (Containerization) + US2 (Basic Deployment) - sufficient for core functionality demonstration

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP First Approach**: Complete User Story 1 (containerization) and User Story 2 (basic deployment) first, then enhance with production features (US3-US5) for full enterprise functionality.
